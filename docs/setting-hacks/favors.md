# Favors

In the world of Moonrise, Resources are replaced with Favors. Characters still possess differing degrees of material wealth and society is far from egalitarian; however, citizens of the Twilight have taken BW's aversion to counting pennies to heart. Rather than "what can you give me?" the world of Moonrise operates on an economy of "what can you do for me?". Favors seeks to answer this question more holistically than Resources - Moonrise is a game about growing a legend, not wealth.

As you adventure in the world, expect those you aid to reward you with promises of favors, rather than wealth or goods.

Beyond the exceptions listed below, refer to the Resources chapter in Burning Wheel Gold.

## Favors Basics

Favors is tested whenever a character wishes to acquire goods or services. When the Favors ability is tested, it represents the character trading favors they have collected or making promises against their own capabilities and reputation.

### Obscurity

Low Favors puts you at risk of descending further into obscurity. You have fewer dice to meet obstacles, so you're more likely to experience tax. This penalty is more severe for characters with a lower Favors rating.

This cycle of obscurity exists by design. It is hard to climb out of obscurity. Characters are expected to take risks in venues outside of Favors. It's not enough to make promises and trade favors to overcome every obstacle.

To break the spiral, you need to look outside of Favors. You'll need to make Linked Tests into Favors or accrue favors to trade by helping other characters across the Twilight.

### Inheritance

One notable difference between Favors and the typical conception of wealth is that Favors are owed by lifepath, not the individual. Similar to inheriting the debts of our forebears, characters in Moonrise inherit the favors and debts of their station.

:::info Example
After retrieving his Ancient Hammer, Blacksmith Murphy of Ruralberg may reward you with a promise from the Blacksmith of Ruralberg. This promise maintains its value even if Blacksmith Murphy is killed before you come to collect. His apprentice, upon becoming Blacksmith of Ruralberg, would then owe the favor.

## Failed Favors Tests: Tax

Typically, when a character fails a Favors test, they do not achieve their intent, but their Favors is temporarily reduced. This is called "tax". Tax represents a temporary loss of the character's standing. Perhaps they boasted too heartily or reneged on a prior promise.

### Trading Favors

Rules regarding Taxed Dice, The Gift of Kindness, and Depleting Resources all function as normal. However, Moonrise offers players another option: Trading Favors.

If a character spends enough promises to match their Favors obstacle, and the test is a failure:

- The promises are spent as normal.
- The character's Favors is not taxed.
- The character gets their intent.
- The character does not log a Favors test.

## Cash, Funds, Titles, and Loans

### Promises

Cash dice take the form of written promises. Promises take various forms in the world of Moonrise - scribbled notes, elaborate deeds, even carved runes - but all that is required is a signatory mark to make a promise binding.

Dice from promises may only be used for one test. After the test, the promise is considered transferred and the advantage dice are lost. The dice-value of promises cannot be split up across tests.

#### The Value of a Promise

The value of a character's promise is determined by their Favors rating. Any promise made is equal to half of the character's Favors in advantage dice, rounded down.

:::info Example
Our friend Blacksmith Murphy has done well for his station and has a B5 Favors. His promise is worth 2D when traded during a Favors test.

### Funds

Funds - whether property, accounts, goods, or caches - are unavailable in Moonrise.

However, you may "stake" a reputation on a deal, if the reputation applies. Tax reduces your reputation dice until all dice are lost and the reputation is erased.
