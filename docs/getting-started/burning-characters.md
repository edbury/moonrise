# Burning Characters

The coming conjunction marks the start of a new era.

Creating a character in Moonrise follows the same process as vanilla Burning Wheel - with some adjustments.

## Called by the Crown

While their gifts manifest at different times, only children are selected to join the order.

- Starting characters in Moonrise are limited to *two* lifepaths.
- Many suggested paths are listed below.
- If you're interested in playing an older member of the order, see [Veterans](#veterans) below.

## The Dim Flame

Though more hospitable than the Day or Night, humans were not meant to live in the Twilight. Children selected for the order share two telltale signs of being touched by the Darkness.

### Child Prodigy

Children selected for the order display an uncanny talent for a single skill.

- Take the `Child Prodigy` trait for free.
- A skill must be selected from skills offered by your first or second Lifepath.

<Callout title="Child Prodigy (Adjusted)">
<p>This trait is only available to one or two lifepath characters. The player may shade shift one skill. Abuse this at your peril.</p>
</Callout>

### Corruption

These talents, however, come with a cost. Children touched by the Darkness are also marked by `Corruption`.

- Take the `Corruption` trait for free.
- When calculating your starting Corruption, add +1 for the `Child Prodigy` trait.
- Rather than roll your initial Corrupted trait, add +1 and +6 to your starting Corruption score. You may select any trait from between those rows on the Corrupted Body and Soul table.

<Callout title="Starting Corruption">
<p>Dolemn is starting the game as the Arcande Devotee.</p>

<p>He has +1 Corruption for <code>Gifted</code> and +1 Corruption for <code>Child Prodigy</code>, giving him a starting Corruption of 2.</p>

<p>Dolmen may select any trait from rows 3 through 8 on the Corrupted Body and Soul table.</p>

<p>He chooses <code>Palsy</code>. Ever since his talent revealed itself, Dolmen has suffered from severe tremors.</p>
</Callout>

## Veterans

If you're interested in playing as an older character, you may opt to play as the party's Veteran. Veterans are existing members of the order who have survived since the crowning of the previous monarch.

Except for special circumstances, there can only be one Veteran in your party. This is a dangerous job, and those who survive are often marked by their service.

- Create your character as above. This represents what they were like at the beginning of their service.
- Veteran characters may select up to *three* additional lifepaths, for a total of *five*.
- For each lifepath selected, add +1 to your starting Corruption and roll on the Corrupted Body and Mind table.
- Yes, each additional lifepath grants an additional Corrupted trait.
