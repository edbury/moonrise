# The World

This planet is old. Old enough to be tidally locked, so a few billion years. There have probably been a few apocalypses, natural and unnatural. I'm imagining it as the end-of-life for the world of Indigo.

At some point in the distant past, the Gods on this world gained / became trapped in physical form. As a result, the mortal connection to the other side was also severed. Faith stopped working. Summoning became useless. When people died, it was final. If you wanted the blessing of a god or to preserve a spirit, you'd have to do it materially: get some of a god's fur, create a phylactery, etc.

Now, far in the future, gods are endangered. They aren't disinterested in the world or living in some other realm. They're mainly dead or slumbering in a literal way. The three societies of the world are basically built around how to contend with a world like this.

The setting is called Moonrise because the moon's orbit crosses the path of the sun. It doesn't create an actual day/night cycle, it provides light shade on the day side and dim light on the night side.

# Three Realms

## The Day

Most of the day side is desert because the sun has burnt away most of the atmosphere, and the ozone layer on this side of the planet is fucked. I'm thinking that nearly all of this side of the planet is abandoned.

At the subsolar point, there's a city built around a giant focusing lens meant to capture the sun light. The two main purposes here, depending on the circumstances/time period:

Channel the sun's energy into a person for religious purposes. The cult on the day side believe the sun's power is deific. I'm toying with the idea of Maketekahu being their undying captive for this purpose. I assume tons of people have been incinerated before by this thing.
Channel the sun's light into a mirror and glass network, meant to illuminate the Twilight and dark side of the planet.

In both cases, I think whoever is in power on the Day Side is on some classic religious fascism shit. Faith works here by virtue of the roden cult mechanics unless the player can find an actual god in play. Other than that, I haven't put too much thought into it because I assume most PCs wouldn't want to start here.

## The Night

The dark side of the planet is mostly a nightmare. There's no light. The seas are mostly frozen. Orcs, trolls, and spiders are entirely unchecked except by each other.

There are two havens:

At the other end of the planet, farthest from the sun, is a city in the middle of the darkness. This is an Obitorium-style sanctuary for those that dwell on the dark side. Most people who live in the city never leave because it's dangerous af outside.

Beyond the city, there are huge (yards to miles wide) networks of bioluminescent fungus. Most people that do travel through the dark use these fields of fungus for light and warmth. Native dwellers cultivate and spread the fungus throughout the dark as a method of terraforming the darkness.

Magically, the Dark Side is special. First, Summoning works on most mortals. Second, nearly everyone has Corruption. These are related: beneath the city, the giant, luminous body of Deel breathes out the entirely opaque spores of the fungus. This was the dark side's solution to the loss of light and the afterlife.

The fungus is destroyed by UV light and fire. Nearly anyone who isn't from the city is unaware of the fungus because the spores are entirely opaque and only exist in the dark; as such, they refer to this fungus simply as The Darkness.

## The Twilight

The thin strip of the world in dim light. Most mortal races live in or near The Twilight because it's the closest to normal habitability. On earth, this is about 36 miles wide. I'm thinking of just keeping those dimensions. Along the band of Twilight, there is wide highway that circumscribes the globe, and the Twilight's monarch considers everything within that band (defined as x miles from the highway) as part of their kingdom.

This is the intended home for PCs, and they likely don't know anything about the above.

People living here have almost no verified knowledge of the Day or Night sides. Nearly everything is based on old stories, legends, or hearsay. Exposure to The Darkness causes Corruption, and people in the Twilight have no knowledge of the fungus. This has led to people regarding the darkness generally as evil, dangerous, etc. Almost everyone in the Twilight takes practical precautions to avoid being in complete darkness as part of their daily life.

People here are not typically Faithful, since miracles don't work. The proximity to The Darkness does give some people the ability to speak with *some* of the dead. Raids by orcs/trolls/spiders aren't unheard of.

Campaigns would center on a renewal of an order that serves the king fighting against the supernatural. The Darkness goes unchecked, there are whisperings from the white deserts, distant villages report ghosts in the streets.
